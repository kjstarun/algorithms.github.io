Problem Statement:
You are given a array.
Sort it in ascending order and remove the duplicates.
Print only the unique elements.

Algorithm:
Step - 1:
    Get an array
Step - 2:
    Sort the array in ascending order and go to step - 3
Step - 3:
    Create a empty array.
Step - 4:
    Iterate the values in the array and check,
    If the value is not in the empty list, add the same to the empty list,
    If the value is already in the empty list, then go for the mnext iteration.
Step - 5:
    Print the empty list.
    # This will print the array in ascending order with no duplicates.
