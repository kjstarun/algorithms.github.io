Problem Statement:
- You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
- You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
- Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Algorithm:
Step- 1:
    Get input from user (prices)

Step- 2:
    Declare a variable for profit and set value to 0.

Step- 3:
    Declare a variable for least price and set value as the day 1 price

Step- 4:
    Iterate the values in the prices as current till end.
    Go to Step- 5

    After iterating all values in prices.
    Go to Step- 7

Step- 5:
    Check whether the iterated value is minimum than the least.
    If True, then set the value for least as the value of current and go to Step- 6
    If False, then go to Step- 6

Step- 6:
    Find the maximum price among the existing profit and the difference between the current and the least.
    And set value of profit to the found maximum price.
    Go to Step- 4

Step- 7:
    Print the Profit.
    # This will be the maximum profit that the seller can sell.
