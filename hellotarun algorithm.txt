
Problem Statement:
There are 3 doors A, B and C.  A has "HELLO", B has "TARUN", C has "HELLO TARUN".
When a person comes and say 
A number divisible by 3, then the Door A should open and say "HELLO".
A number divisible by 5, then the Door B should open and say "TARUN".
A number divisible by 3 and 5, then the Door C should open and say "HELLO TARUN".
Algorithm:
Step- 1:
	Get input from user.
Step - 2:
	Check whether the input is divisible by both 3 and 5
	If True, Say "HELLO TARUN" and termniate.
	If False, Go to Step- 3
Step- 3:
	Check whether the input is divisible by 3
	If True, Say "HELLO" and termniate.
	If False, Go to Step- 4
Step- 4:
	Check whether the input is divisible by 5
	If True, Say "TARUN" and termniate.
	If False, Go to Step- 5
Step- 5:
	Say "INVALID INPUT" and termniate.
